# Welcome

Welcome to my personal website! I'm Jordan, a software developer and writer based in London.

This site is intended to serve as a showcase for my work. You can read more about me [here](/about), read my thoughts about a plethora of topics [here](/blog), and dive deeper into my current and past projects [here](/projects).

I have recently released [*Stipple Effect*](/projects/stipple-effect), a pixel art editor with scripting and animation support that can become a disruptor in 2D game development. Post-release, my focus is on gaining more user feedback and exposure, enhancing its features, and improving the documentation for the [core pixel art editor](/se/docs) and the [scripting API](/se/api).

Now that *Stipple Effect* takes up less of my time than it did leading up to and immediately following its initial release, I am searching for an exciting role in software that complements my skill set and will help me grow and improve as a programmer and a member of a team.

The best way to contact me is via email or LinkedIn.
